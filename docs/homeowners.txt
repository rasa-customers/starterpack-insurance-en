1. Homeowners Insurance Policy Coverage

Q: What is included in my homeowners policy?
A: Your homeowners insurance policy provides financial protection for your home and personal belongings against unexpected events. A standard policy (often called an HO-3 policy) typically includes several key areas of protection:
Dwelling Coverage (Coverage A): This covers the physical structure of your home, such as the walls, roof, floors, and built-in appliances, against damage from events like fire, windstorms, hail, and theft.
Other Structures (Coverage B): This covers structures on your property that are not attached to your house, such as a detached garage, shed, or fence.
Personal Property Coverage (Coverage C): This covers your personal belongings, like furniture, clothing, electronics, and other possessions, against theft or damage from covered disasters, both inside your home and elsewhere.
Liability Coverage (Coverage E): This protects you against lawsuits for bodily injury or property damage that you or your family members cause to other people. It also covers the cost of legal defense.
Additional Living Expenses (ALE) / Loss of Use (Coverage D): If your home becomes uninhabitable due to a covered event, this helps pay for reasonable costs of temporarily living elsewhere, such as hotel bills and restaurant meals, above your normal expenses.
Medical Payments to Others (Coverage F): This covers minor medical bills for someone who is injured on your property, regardless of fault.

Q: Am I covered for accidental damage?
A: Many standard homeowners policies provide broad coverage for various types of accidental damage. For example, damage to your home's structure is often covered on an "open perils" basis, meaning it's covered unless specifically excluded. Personal property is often covered on a "named perils" basis (e.g., fire, theft, wind), but you can often upgrade this coverage. For incidents like spilling paint on a carpet, you would need to check your specific policy details to see what is covered.

Q: Does my homeowners insurance cover flood or earthquake damage?
A: No, standard homeowners insurance policies do not cover damage from floods or earthquakes. You must purchase separate policies for this coverage. Flood insurance is available through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and some private insurers. Earthquake insurance can also be bought as a separate policy or an endorsement to your existing policy.

Q: Are my garden and shed covered?
A: Yes, sheds and other unattached structures are typically covered under the "Other Structures" portion of your policy. Landscaping, trees, and plants are also often covered, but usually for a limited amount and only for specific perils like fire or vandalism, not wind or disease.

2. Homeowners Insurance Exclusions
Q: What is typically not covered by a standard homeowners policy?
A: While homeowners insurance is comprehensive, there are common exclusions. These typically include:
Floods and Earthquakes: As mentioned, these require separate policies.
General Wear and Tear: Issues that arise from the gradual aging and deterioration of your property are not covered.
Damage due to Neglect or Lack of Maintenance: For example, damage from a slow leak that you haven't fixed is usually not covered.
Pest and Vermin Infestations: Damage caused by termites, insects, rats, or other pests is typically excluded.
Intentional Damage: You are not covered for any damage you or a member of your household causes on purpose.
High-Value Items: Standard policies have limits on the amount you can claim for valuable items like jewelry, art, or firearms. You will need to purchase a special endorsement or "floater" to fully insure these items.
Running a Business from Home: A standard policy provides very limited coverage for business-related property or liability. If you run a business from home, you will likely need a separate business or commercial policy.

3. Making a Homeowners Insurance Claim
Q: What is a deductible?
A: A deductible is the amount of money you are responsible for paying out-of-pocket before your insurance coverage begins to pay. For example, if you have a $1,000 deductible and a covered claim for $10,000 in damages, you would pay the first $1,000, and your insurer would pay the remaining $9,000.

Q: Will making a claim affect my future premiums?
A: Making a claim on your homeowners insurance can lead to an increase in your premium at renewal time. You may also lose any claims-free discount you have accumulated. It is worth considering whether it is financially sensible to claim for minor incidents where the cost of the damage is not much more than your policy deductible.
